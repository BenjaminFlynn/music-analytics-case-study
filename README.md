# music-analytics-case-study
📊 Data science project analyzing music streaming behavior using Python. Includes visualizations, statistical insights, and a predictive model to explore trends in song popularity and listener engagement.

# 🎧 Music Streaming Analytics Dashboard

**Author:** Benjamin Flynn  
**Last Updated:** May 2025

## 📊 Overview

This project analyzes music streaming data to uncover trends in listener behavior, song popularity, and genre performance. Using tools from Python's data science ecosystem, I built a visual and statistical dashboard aimed at generating marketing and business insights for the music industry.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Explore how users engage with music across countries, genres, and platforms.
- Identify key drivers behind a song’s popularity (e.g. release timing, audio features).
- Build a dashboard with charts and summaries for real-time insights.
- Practice core data science skills (wrangling, analysis, modeling, visualization).

## 📌 Key Features
- Listener trends by region and genre
- Time-of-day or day-of-week streaming patterns
- Song popularity predictors (regression models)
- A/B test simulation on release dates
- Streamlit-based interactive dashboard
